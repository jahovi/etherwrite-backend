# EVA â€“ The EtherWrite Data Processing Service

## Developing

To start the development server, execute `npm run dev`.

## Building

To produce a build, execute `npm run build`.

## Environment

Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory with the following content (change values accordingly):

```
PORT=8083
COUCH_DB_USER=somename
COUCH_DB_PWD=password
COUCH_DB_HOST=localhost
COUCH_DB_PORT=5984

CSP_UPDATE_DELAY=5000

TRS_UPDATE_DELAY=2000
ETHERVIZ_MAX_STATUS_BLOCKS=12
PADREG_UPDATE_DELAY=5000
PADS_IGNORE= 
```
PADS_IGNORE can be filled with one or more names of pads, separated by commas. These will be ignored by EVA Services that are launched by the pad registry. 

## Structure

Routers are created as classes implementing the `Router` interface. They should add all their routes in the `init` method by using `app.get`
, `app.put` etc.

Don't forget to register your router in `src/routers.ts`!

## Test connection to CouchDB

Execute request `GET localhost:8083/dbtest?dbname=<your db name>` to test database connection.

## Endpoints

### /minimap/authorInfo

Execute request `GET localhost:8083/minimap/authorInfo` to receive an object containing information about all authors EVA currently 
knows. Be sure to request this regularly to be informed about eventual color changes by the authors. 

```js
{
  [epid: string]: {
    epalias:string;
    color: string;
    mapper2author: string
  }
}
````

epid -- etherpad id  
epalias -- the alias name, that the author may or may not have entered in the etherpad text editor  
color: -- the color that is associated with this author according to the database  
mapper2author -- delivers the 'XX' from the mapper2author:XX files in couchdb that is assigned to the etherpad id of this author, IF there
is such a file in the couchdb for this etherpad id.

### /minimap/blockInfo

Execute request `GET localhost:8083/minimap/blockInfo?padName=<your pad name>` to receive a sequence of data representing the blocks of text. The beginning of a new block indicates that the author and/or the ignoreColor-flag has changed compared to the previous block. Each object of the sequence has this form:

````js
{
  author: string, 
  blockLength: number,
  lineBreakIndices ?: number[],
  ignoreColor?:boolean,
  headingStartIndices?:number[],
  headingTypes?:{[key:number]:string},
}
````

author -- the etherpad id of the author of this text block   
blockLength -- the number of characters in this text block (linebreaks count as characters too)  
lineBreakIndices -- enumerates the relative indices in this block, where a linebreak is located. May be empty or
otherwise contains number in the range of 0 to (blockLength-1) in ascending order. The order in which the elements in this list are placed is identical to the order of the corresponding text structure in the etherpad text.  
ignoreColor -- if true, this indicates that all the text in this block has been set to remove the author colors in the etherpad editor.   
headingStartIndices -- may contain zero or more relative indices in ascending order. Each of these indices means, that all following  characters are to be printed as headline. Every headline ends at the next following linebreak. Be aware that this linebreak may occur in one of the later blocks. IMPORTANT: Each heading start index is associated with a *-character that is invisible in the editor and accordingly should NOT be represented by a character in the minimap.  
headingTypes -- For each index in headingStartIndices this contains the information about its size ("h1","h2","h3","h4"). The startIndex serves as key to the corresponding heading type in this object.  

### /authoring_ratios

Returns as json an object containing corresponding authors, moodle IDs, authoring ratios and colors for each pad. The ratios are given 
as percentages rounded to two decimal places. Without arguments data for all pads is returned. 
If the current user is not a moderator calls without a pad argument will be denied.

Example:

```js
{
  nameOfFirstPad: { 
    authors: [nameAuthor1, nameAuthor2, ...],
    moodleIDs: [moodleIDAuthor1, moodleIDAuthor2, ...],
    ratios: [anteilAutor1, anteilAutor2, ...],
    colors: [farbeAutor1, farbeAutor2, ...]
  }
  nameOfSecondPad: {
    authors: [nameAuthor1, nameAuthor2, ...],
    moodleIDs: [moodleIDAuthor1, moodleIDAuthor2, ...],
    ratios: [ratioAutor1, ratioAutor2, ...],
    colors: [colorAutor1, colorAutor2, ...]
  }
  ...
}
```

With an argument of `pad=PADNAME`, only data for the specified pad will be returned. If the current user is a moderator, individual users' values will be returned. Example:

```js
{
  authors: [nameAuthor1, nameAuthor2, ...],
  moodleIDs: [moodleIDAuthor1, moodleIDAuthor2, ...],
  ratios: [anteilAutor1, anteilAutor2, ...],
  colors: [farbeAutor1, farbeAutor2, ...]
}
```

If the current user is not a moderator, other users' values will be aggregated like so:

```js
{
  authors: [nameAuthor1, "Andere"],
  moodleIDs: [moodleIDAuthor1, null],
  ratios: [anteilAutor1, summierterAnteilDerAnderen],
  colors: [farbeAutor1, "#808080"]
}
```

The functionality is implemented in the following files:

- src/authoring-ratios.router.ts
- src/authoring-ratios-service/authoring-ratios-calculator.ts
- src/core/couch/documents/authoring-ratios-view.ts

### /minimap/scrollPositions

Execute request `GET localhost:8083/minimap/scrollPositions?padName=<your pad name>` to receive information gathered 
by the ep-tracking module about the latest scroll positions of users. Will only contain data regarding 
authors that can be assumed to currently have openend that pad. I.e. users, for which ep-tracking has a 
disconnect event that is newer than the latest connect event or the latest scroll event, will be excluded.  
The data is structured as follows:  

```js
{
	[key: string]:
	{
		timeStamp: number,
		topIndex: number,
		bottomIndex?: number,
	}
}
```

### /getEtherVizData

Execute request `GET localhost:8083/getEtherVizData?pad=<your pad name>` to receive the data for
generating an EtherViz chart for the specified pad.  
The data is structured as follows: 

```js
{
	dateTime:string,
	/**A rectangle describes a status block */
	rectangles: EtherVizColumnItem[], 
	/**A parallelogram describes the transitions from
	 * the characters that are part of the rectangles
	 * block to the status block after the cuurent one. 
	 */
	parallelograms?: EtherVizColumnItem[] 
}
```

The structure of an EtherVizColumnItem:  
```js
{
	authorId:string,
	authorColor:string,
	upperLeft: number,
	upperRight?:number,
	lowerLeft:number,
	lowerRight?:number,
}
```

### /activity/activities

`GET localhost:8083/activity/activities?padName=<your pad name>` will return the activities that took place in the requested pad, i.e. 
the number of changesets. They will be aggregated by hour, or, if the entire project already lasted longer than 3 days, by day.

The returned data is structured as follows:
```js
[
	{
		timeStamp: string, // Readable date/datetime string
		authorToActivities: {
			[authorMoodleId: string]: number,
        }, 
	}
]
```

### /activity/operations

`GET localhost:8083/activity/activities?padName=<your pad name>` will return the operations that took place in the requested pad, i.e. 
the number of changesets distinguished by the type of operation. Possible operations are: 
- WRITE (adding text)
- EDIT (formatting already written text)
- DELETE (removing text)
- PASTE (pasting a number of characters)
They will be aggregated by hour, or, if the entire project already lasted longer than 3 days, by day.

The returned data is structured as follows:
```js
[
	{
		timeStamp: string, // Readable date/datetime string
		authorToOperations: {
			[authorMoodleId: string]: {
				WRITE?: number,
				EDIT?: number,
				DELETE?: number,
				PASTE?: number,
            },
        }, 
	}
]
```

### /getCohDiagData
`GET localhost:8083/getCohDiagData?padName=<your pad name>` will return the data needed for drawing the cohesion diagram. 

The returned data is structured as follows: 
```js
{
	nodes: Node[],
	distances: NodeDistance[],
	connections: NodeConnection[]
}
```
The auxiliary data structures: 
```js
Node { 
	id: string, 
	name: string, 
	color: string 
}

NodeDistance { 
	source: string, 
	target: string, 
	dist: number 
}

NodeConnection { 
	source: string, 
	target: string, 
	intensity: number 
}
```
